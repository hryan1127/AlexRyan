<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have over 8 years of experience in politics and government, which taught me to manage multiple projects at once, communicate efficiently and effectively, 
  value teamwork, and analyze data to diagnose issues, prescribe solutions, and forecast future outcomes. Data is where my true passion exists. Essentially it
  is the root that defines and strenghtens all of my other interests. I believe that if we have an accurate understanding of the past and present that we can 
  better forecast what we can expect in the future and plan accordingly for a multitude of situations. I love being able to analyze data and have a full 
  conversation with it by asking the pertinent questions to find actionable solutions as well as to fully understand the current environment.</p>
